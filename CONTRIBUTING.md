## Making a change

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-to-contribute]. Another useful source of information is [First Timers Only][first-timers].

Please use the `develop` branch as starting point for your own branch, and the target for any pull requests.

If you're adding a commodity, at the very minimum it will need a `compose-fragment.yml` and a README entry. If there is support for extra functionality such as provisioning snippets, then a working example should be placed in the snippets directory and linked to from the README.
